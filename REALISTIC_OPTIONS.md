## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Truth About iOS Installation

Apple has strict rules. Here are your REAL options:

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Keep Using Expo Go (EASIEST - Recommended)

**No building, no hassle, works forever!**

1. Keep `npm start` running on your PC
2. Open Expo Go on iPhone
3. Scan QR code
4. App loads and works!

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ 100% Free
- ‚úÖ No Apple account needed

- ‚úÖ Works forever

**Cons:**

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Build for Simulator (Testing Only)

Build an iOS simulator version (doesn't run on real iPhone, only for testing):

```powershell
eas build --platform ios --profile development
```

This works without Apple account but only runs in iOS Simulator on Mac.

## ‚úÖ Option 3: Get Apple Developer Account ($99/year)

If you want a standalone app on your real iPhone:

1. **Sign up for Apple Developer Program**
   - Go to: https://developer.apple.com/programs/

   ```
   - Provide your Apple ID when asked
   - EAS handles the rest

3. **Install via link or TestFlight**

## ‚úÖ Option 4: AltStore (7-day sideloading)

Free but requires refreshing every 7 days:

1. **Download AltStore:** https://altstore.io/
2. **Install on PC and iPhone**
3. **Build app normally** (get .ipa file)
4. **Sideload via AltStore**

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free

```

- No complicated setup

Just:
